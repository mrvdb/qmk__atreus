# Flash the generated hex file

# Step that I want:
# 1. put the board in bootloader mode
# 2. simulate flash (-n flag to avrdude)
# 3. check for continue
# 4. put the board in bootloader mode
# 5. do flash for real

echo "Put the device in bootloader mode; hold ESC and press K, keep pressing ESC"
# This only works with QMK, not with Kaleidoscope
# Must use an udevadm version which has wait implemented
/usr/bin/udevadm wait $DEVICE


# This works, manually unplugging the board and plugging back in with ESC pressed
echo "Flashing...."
