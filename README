Build custom firmware for keyboard.io model atreus


doc: https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_building_firmware_workflow

Roughly how it works:

- use https://config.qmk.fm/ to load atreus.json

- adjust what is needed, possibly compile firmware and flash until done

- download the updated json file in this repo

- commit and push to github, github workflow will build the firmware and produce it as artifact


Rationale:
- provide backup for local setup which is fragile on powerpc64le / guix
- have verification: take same json file, produce artifact and compare with locally build firwmare (deterministic?]
