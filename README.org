* Build custom firmware for [[https://shop.keyboard.io/collections/keyboardio-atreus][keyboard.io model Atreus]] in two ways

1. Using a github action which takes  =atreus.json= and builds binary firmware
2. A script (=build=) which uses a GUIX container to build it locally using qmk



** Ad 1.

doc: https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_building_firmware_workflow

Roughly how it works:

- use https://config.qmk.fm/ to load atreus.json

- adjust what is needed, possibly compile firmware and flash until done

- download the updated json file in this repo

- commit and push to github, github workflow will build the firmware and produce it as artifact


** Ad 2

=build= shell script spawns a GUIX shell and builds firmware locally using =manifest.scm=

* Rationale:
- provide backup for local setup which is fragile on powerpc64le / guix
- have verification: take same json file, produce artifact and compare with locally build firwmare (deterministic?]

* Misc
Keymapping doc:

- Layer 0 :: Base layer
- Layer 1 :: Number keys, navigation and bracketing
- Layer 2 :: Function layer, macros
- Layer 3 :: Specials and dangerous key combinations\n

* TODO Make C-M-a easier

The right alt key is actually alt-gr so that maps to =C-ä= instead of =C-M-a=

Either:
- map C-ä to the sam
